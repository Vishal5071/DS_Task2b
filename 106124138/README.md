## Binary TreesProject Overview
This assignment focuses on two problems using a Binary Tree built from a level-order array
### Minimum Phones
    Find the minimum number of nodes (phones) required to cover every node (family member) in the tree using a **Greedy DFS algorithm**.
### XOR Calculation
    Find the count of phone pairs whose prime value XOR is outside a given range *[l, r]*.

## Build and Run

1. To compile the code (assuming main.c and helper.c are used) and run the executable:
**Compile**:
    ```bash
    make all
    ```
**Run**:
    ```bash
    make run
    ```
**Clean**: 
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```
## Design Note
The Minimum Phones part is solved using a Greedy Depth-First Search (DFS) that efficiently finds the minimum coverage.
